        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to the  Tenants
        Association website. Our purpose is to advocate as tenants for the tenants with
        the management. We will also seek to foster understanding and cooperation between
        the management and tenants. Please take a few minutes to browse through this website
        to see all that we offer. We hope you will take the opportunity to participate in
        the website and help make  a better place to live.<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; A good place to start is with the Why? page. This will explain
        how the began and why we believe this is a positive step for  tenants
        and management.</span>
