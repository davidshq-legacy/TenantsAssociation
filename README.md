# Introduction
For a while, many years ago, I lived in an apartment complex that really had some problems. Being young and passionate I decided to build a work order system that would be public for the apartment complex (not at their request!) to hold them accountable for the state of the complex. This resulted in several quite nasty conversations with management and a threat of a lawsuit against me. Not fun times!

Anyways, this is here mainly for historical purposes. It was written in perhaps 2 months in 2006 on nights and weekends using ASP.NET, VB.NET, and MSSQL. I thought perhaps that it would be something that could be used by tenants at other complexes to hold the owners accountable...

I've removed all mentions of the organization as well as various content I had written relating to the complex and my thoughts on tenant's rights...Probably this code will just sit here, but feel free to use if you desire...just remember that I make no guarantees and assume no liability.

# Features
* Ability for tenants to create tickets.
* Ability for tenants to update tickets.
* Ability for owners to review and respond to tickets.
* Other stuff I don't remember.
